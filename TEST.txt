**Poor Queries**
1. the ics community vs ics community
- the addition of the word "the" created a difference in results and computation time
- remove stop words if they don't matter significantly to the meaning of the query

2. acm
- one word query: could be faster
- sorted postings by descending score to optimize one word queries

3. machine learning
- contained pages with low textual content at the top of the results
- filtered out short pages or pages with low textual content

4. master of software engineering vs software engineering master
- stop words created an effect on the results and query computation time
- remove stop words if they don't matter significantly to the meaning of the query

5. courses that the stats department offers
- relatively long query that includes some stop words, query took >300ms
- set a threshold for document score to perform calculations on only relevant documents

6. undergraduate requirements for computer science majors
